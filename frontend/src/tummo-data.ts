    "description": "Tummo breathing is a Tibetan meditation technique combining rhythmic breathing, visualization, and muscle tension to generate inner warmth.

    "steps": [
        "Find a quiet space and sit comfortably in a cross-legged position or on a chair with your spine straight and shoulders relaxed.",
        "Close your eyes and take a few natural breaths to center yourself and release any tension in your body.",
        "Inhale deeply through your nose for 4-5 counts, filling your lungs from the belly upward, allowing your abdomen to expand fully.",
        "Hold your breath gently for 3-5 seconds while engaging your core muscles and pelvic floor, creating a sense of inner pressure.",
        "Visualize a glowing, warm flame at your navel center (about three finger-widths below your belly button), feeling its heat radiating outward.",
        "Exhale slowly and completely through your mouth for 6-7 counts, releasing all tension and allowing your body to relax fully.",
        "Continue this breathing pattern for 10-15 rounds, maintaining focus on the warming sensation in your core.",
        "After completing the rounds, sit quietly for 2-3 minutes, observing the sensations of warmth and energy throughout your body.",
        "Gradually return your awareness to your surroundings, gently opening your eyes when ready."
